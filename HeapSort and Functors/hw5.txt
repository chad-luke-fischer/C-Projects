Analyze the running time of your new k-way templated Merge Sort:
Runtime of my mergesort is O(klogk)

Which algorithm would you say that your k-way mergeSort resembles when k=n?
When k=n my alogorithm runs a selection sort to correctly sort elements

What is its running time in that case?
In this case the runtime is O(k^2logk)
