 Problem 3:

 a) Map: A map would be the best option to store unique zipcodes without an order. Voting statistics can be easily acessed by supplying the zip code.  

 b) Set: The order of the data also doesn't have an impact here, you only need the students who have. 

 c) Array: It would be easy to store the collectable pokemon in an array parralell to their poke index.

 d) Map with an array of strings: the key would be the movie name and year to find all the relevant reviews.

 Problem 4:
 Function A recursively searches until it reaches the end of the linked list. Function B switches the order of the pointers. For example while 4 pointed to 5, 5 then points to 4. As a result, running of the selected code will recursively flip the order of the numbers. If the input was a list with the elements {1,2,3,4,5}, the list would be reversed resulting in {5,4,3,2,1}.
